# Python_Lessons

In this repository, I will accumulate the work and excercises that I complete to maintain my Python coding skills. Through this process I hope that I can create articles to post so that I can help other people who are learning Python, or just looking for refreshers on some topics. I will also be including articles that are published on here so that they are easily accessible.
