# Python Lessons

  In this repository, I will accumulate the work and excercises that I complete to maintain my Python coding skills. Through this process I hope that I can create articles to post so that I can help other people who are learning Python, or just looking for refreshers on some topics. I will also be including articles that are published on here so that they are easily accessible.

  I hope that by creating this repository and maintaining all my exercises together that it can also help in being able to explain Python processes in a way that can be accessible to a non-technical population, thus improving my written communication skills.
